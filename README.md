	Step 1- Save the jar file in an appropriate folder on your local machine.

  Step 2- Simply double click on the jar file at any time to open it.

  Step 3-

    If you’d like to create a model from scratch simply start typing in the blanks screen provided and save your work. Your file will automatically have the .als extention and can now be opened by any Alloy Analyzer Tool on any machine.

    Otherwise, if you’d like to open an existing .als file then you can either use the “open” button on the navigation bar or go to File -> Open. Navigate to your desired file. Once it is opened in your tool, you have the option to modify it directly or use it as a template to create a new file with a new name.

  Note: the tool allows you to open multiple files at once.
